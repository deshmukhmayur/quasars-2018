Yeah!! The time has come for which seniors have been anticipating and juniors have been awaiting! It’s time for \*drum rolls\* Quasars!!

We all know deogiri is known for its discipline and attendance but it's also known for it’s annual social gathering. For the next month we will be seeing each other’s facebook and instagram posts with the #Quasars2k18. Yep. Get ready for tons of those! :P

Quasars is what we call the annual function and social gathering of our college- Deogiri institute of engineering and management studies. Every year it is held between january and february. It’s a whole new opportunity for the  juniors (i.e. who have just joined college), whereas, it’s the same old love for the seniors.

The word ‘quasars’ has an english origin and it basically means a group of massive celestial objects which emit a lot of energy and if viewed from telescope it looks like a star. It has been suggested that quasars have huge black holes within them and represents a stage in formation of some galaxies. Science. That’s enough about it.

Now let’s talk about what actually happens at deogiri when it’s Quasars time.
First things first, the total vibe of our college changes and I mean it. You must have started to feel this in our campus. The dance practices, flashmob preparation, state day practices then there are sports events, random people like me start playing badminton on the court which is opposite to the Vishwakarma hall and so on. You get my point. There are so many events in our gathering. As I mentioned earlier, there’s state day, singing and dancing(both solo and in group) and there’s drama,too. All these main stage events, which I personally look forward to, take place on the ground  opposite to the college entrance. The indoor events include industry 360, art and craft events, rangoli and mehendi competition. And the list goes on….

Every year, we have this grand event, and our college spends a handsome amount for it. It often happens that students don’t show active participation in the competitions and activities. Some of the students think it as a break of one or two weeks from college’s monotonous schedule. Seniors and gathering coordinators literally have to campaign again and again going in all the classes to cheer up people and tell them about various events. That’s insane. This repulsive attitude is understandable for first year students as it’s their first time. They might feel shy or think how should I participate in certain competition or main stage event. But you gotta have first time for everything right? I remember when I was a first year student, I had this perception of our college that we have to attend all lectures, attendance is important than one extra hour of sleep, and we have to follow the rules. I never knew our gathering would be this lit. You’ll get to see that.

I think everyone should take full advantage of something which is all arranged for you. Having said that, there are no cons in participating in any event of gathering. Pros are you get to know new people, some very strong friendships are built in such events, you get to work in groups and know why team building is important, you learn how to deal with conflictual situations and people’s egos (let’s admit we all have some), you get to know the other side of your teachers and the shy students who don’t really talk much in class. All these are Life Learnings. You won’t learn such things sitting in a class, listening to the teachers and trying to understand what’s written on the board.

Let’s face it- these four years of engineering will pass in a blink of an eye. Time is a circus, always packing up and going away. Try to make as many memories as you can. So that, when you pass out and get older you won’t have any regrets of not enjoying college events and social gatherings. Don’t miss out on the fun  :)
